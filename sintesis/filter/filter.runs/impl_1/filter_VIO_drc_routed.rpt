DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP filter_DUT/gen_mult[16].MULTi/internal_result_reg output filter_DUT/gen_mult[16].MULTi/internal_result_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.
